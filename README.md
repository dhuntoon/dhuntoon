**Who I am**

Hi, I'm Dylan Huntoon (@dhuntoon), and I am an undergraduate student at Purdue University. I'm studying Computer Engineering with a focus in software development for embedded systems. 

**My Interests**

I am passionate about space exploration (I actually started my education in Aeronautics and Astronautics) and software for space flight. In most of my Aerospace Engineering projects, I have played a systems engineering role - helping to make informed and justifiable decisions with research. I hope to continue working in teams where I can use my software engineering skills for space applications.
